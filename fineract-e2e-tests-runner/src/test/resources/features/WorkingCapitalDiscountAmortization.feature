    Then Admin successfully approves the working capital loan on "01 January 2026" with "9000" amount and expected disbursement date on "01 January 2026"
    Then Admin successfully disburse the Working Capital loan on "01 January 2026" with "9000" EUR transaction amount
    Then Working Capital loan status will be "ACTIVE"
    Then Admin successfully add discount with "1000" amount on Working Capital loan account
    And Customer makes repayment on "01 January 2026" with 50 transaction amount on Working Capital loan
    And Working Capital Loan has transactions:
